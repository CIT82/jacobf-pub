    To ensure containment of SCP-3008, the Foundation has acquired and repurposed the retail park housing SCP-3008 into Site-██. Public access to roads leading to or passing by Site-██ has been redirected to minimize exposure.
    
    Continuous monitoring of the entrance to SCP-3008 is mandated, with strict prohibition on unauthorized entry except for testing purposes, as authorized by the Senior Researcher. Individuals exiting SCP-3008 are to be detained for debriefing prior to the administration of amnestics. Depending on their duration of stay, a suitable cover story may be devised before their release.
    
    Any non-human entities exiting SCP-3008 are to be terminated immediately to prevent potential breaches.
    
    SCP-3008 is a retail unit formerly operated by IKEA, known for its anomalous properties. Upon entering SCP-3008, individuals are transported to SCP-3008-1, a vast space resembling the interior of an IKEA store, extending far beyond the retail unit's physical dimensions. SCP-3008-1 is inhabited by civilians who were trapped within prior to containment, forming a primitive society complete with settlements and fortifications.
    
    However, SCP-3008-1 is also inhabited by SCP-3008-2, humanoid entities resembling IKEA employees with distorted proportions and lacking facial features. SCP-3008-2 becomes hostile during SCP-3008-1's "night" phase, attacking all other lifeforms within. They vocalize phrases in English such as "The store is now closed, please exit the building." During the "day" phase, SCP-3008-2 becomes passive but unresponsive.
    
    SCP-3008-1 exhibits a rudimentary day-night cycle, determined by overhead lighting that activates and deactivates corresponding to the opening and closing times of the original store. Exiting SCP-3008-1 is challenging due to the elusive nature of its exits, which do not have fixed positions. Attempts to enter through alternate doors or walls lead to the non-anomalous interior of the original store.
    
    Incident 3008-1 involved the exit of a human male followed closely by an instance of SCP-3008-2, resulting in the termination of the individual by SCP-3008-2 before its own termination by security personnel. This remains the only recorded instance of an SCP-3008-2 entity exiting SCP-3008, prompting further investigation detailed in the 3008-2 Autopsy Log</p>
