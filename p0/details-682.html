  <p>SCP-682, known colloquially as "The Hard-to-Destroy Reptile," presents an unprecedented threat to containment and poses a significant danger to all life forms. The urgent imperative is the destruction of SCP-682 due to its relentless attempts to breach containment and its unyielding hostility towards all life.

    Containment protocols for SCP-682 mandate confinement within a specially designed chamber measuring 5 m x 5 m x 5 m. The interior surfaces of the chamber are lined with 25 cm reinforced acid-resistant steel plates. Hydrochloric acid fills the chamber to submerge SCP-682, rendering it temporarily incapacitated. Any movement, vocalization, or attempt to breach containment by SCP-682 triggers an immediate and forceful response to maintain containment integrity.
    
    Direct communication with SCP-682 is strictly forbidden, as it may provoke an aggressive response. Unauthorized personnel attempting communication with SCP-682 will be promptly restrained and removed by force to prevent potential escalation.
    
    Due to the inherent difficulties in containing and neutralizing SCP-682, it is housed at Site [REDACTED], which is situated in an isolated area with a 50-kilometer buffer zone free from human development. The Foundation allocates optimal resources to monitor and secure this site, prioritizing the containment of SCP-682 to prevent any breaches and minimize the risk of exposure to the public.
    
    SCP-682 exhibits remarkable intelligence and displays a deep-seated animosity towards all life forms, as evidenced by its communication with SCP-079 during limited exposure. Its physical attributes, including strength, speed, and reflexes, are exceptionally high and variable based on its form. SCP-682 demonstrates rapid regeneration and adaptability, deriving energy from any material it consumes, organic or inorganic. Even when severely damaged or rotted, SCP-682 remains operational and continues to pose a significant threat.
    
    In the event of a containment breach, Mobile Task Forces are mobilized to track and recapture SCP-682 using all available resources. Engagements with SCP-682 require teams of no fewer than seven members, as it has exhibited a history of successful breaches, numbering six to date. The Foundation remains vigilant in containing SCP-682 and continuously evaluates containment strategies to mitigate the threat it poses to humanity and the anomaly containment efforts.</p>
