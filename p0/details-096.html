  <p>SCP-096 is contained within a highly secure steel cube measuring 5 meters on each side, with regular checks to ensure its integrity. Inside the cell, no optical surveillance devices are allowed, and instead, security relies on pressure sensors and laser detectors to monitor SCP-096's movements.

    Described as a humanoid entity approximately 2.38 meters tall, SCP-096 displays minimal muscle mass and notably elongated arms. Its skin lacks pigmentation, and its eyes, also devoid of color, contribute to its unsettling appearance. While SCP-096 lacks higher brain functions and is considered non-sapient, it possesses an instinctual response mechanism.
    
    When its face is directly viewed, whether in person, via recording, or through a photograph, SCP-096 enters a state of extreme distress. It covers its face with its hands, exhibiting behaviors such as screaming, crying, and incoherent babbling. Approximately one to two minutes after the initial viewing, SCP-096 will enter a frenzied state and pursue the individual who viewed its face, designated SCP-096-1.
    
    SCP-096's speed during pursuit has been documented as ranging from thirty-five kilometers per hour to ███ kilometers per hour, depending on the distance from SCP-096-1. Remarkably, SCP-096 seems to possess an innate ability to locate SCP-096-1 regardless of their position.
    
    Upon reaching SCP-096-1, SCP-096 engages in lethal violence, resulting in the termination and complete disappearance of SCP-096-1. Following this, SCP-096 will briefly remain seated before regaining its composure and returning to a docile state. It then seeks to retreat to its natural habitat, the location of which is redacted from documentation.
    
    Given the severe risks associated with SCP-096's behavior, including the potential for mass casualties and breaches of secrecy, its termination has been proposed and approved. However, the termination process has yet to be executed.</p>
