  <p>To enhance containment measures for SCP-3001 and prevent accidental entries, the Foundation has implemented upgrades and modifications to all reality-bending technology. These enhancements include multiple safeguards designed to prevent the creation of Class-C "Broken Entry" Wormholes. While information regarding SCP-3001 is accessible to personnel of any level, research and experimentation with SCP-3001 and its associated technology are restricted to personnel of Level 3 clearance and above. Special clearance designation is granted from Sites 120, 121, 124, and 133.

    SCP-3001 is a hypothesized paradoxical parallel or pocket "non-dimension" accessible through the creation of a momentary Class-C "Broken Entry" Wormhole. It is believed to be an infinitely extending parallel universe with an extremely low Hume Level of 0.032, which contradicts Kejel's Laws of Reality regarding the relation between Humes and spacetime. This phenomenon causes matter inside SCP-3001 to decay at an extraordinarily slow rate, allowing organisms to survive severe tissue damage as long as a portion of the brain remains intact. However, prolonged exposure leads to gradual tissue and structural damage as the matter's Hume Field disintegrates to match that of SCP-3001.
    
    SCP-3001 was first discovered on January 2, 2000, at Site-120 during the testing of reality-bending technology. Dr. Robert Scranton and Dr. Anna Lang, the Head Researchers at Site-120, were developing the experimental "Lang-Scranton Stabilizer" (LSS) device when Dr. Scranton was unexpectedly transported to SCP-3001 due to seismic activity damaging several active LSS units in Reality Lab A.
    
    Despite initial presumptions of his demise, Dr. Scranton survived within SCP-3001 for at least five years, 11 months, and 21 days. He recorded his experiences and observations using a functioning LSS control panel, which accompanied him through the Class-C "Broken Entry" Wormhole. These recordings were later recovered upon the panel's return during testing of improved reality-bending technology, providing valuable insight into SCP-3001. However, retrieval and reintegration of Dr. Scranton have thus far been unsuccessful, and his current physical and mental states remain unknown, pending further review by the Ethics Committee.
    
    The transcripts of Dr. Scranton's logs serve as the primary basis for the study of SCP-3001, shedding light on its anomalous properties and the challenges associated with containment and exploration.</p>
