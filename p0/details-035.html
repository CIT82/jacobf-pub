  <p>SCP-035 is a highly anomalous object with the appearance of a porcelain comedy mask, occasionally transitioning to a tragedy mask. It is contained within a hermetically sealed glass case, surrounded by steel, iron, and lead shielding. Strict containment procedures are in place, including triple-locked doors and armed guards stationed outside the containment room. Personnel are prohibited from direct contact with SCP-035, and a trained psychologist must remain on-site at all times.

    The mask emits a corrosive liquid from its eye and mouth holes, causing decay in anything it touches, including living organisms. Subjects within close proximity to SCP-035 experience a compelling urge to wear it. When worn, SCP-035 overrides the wearer's consciousness, leading to brain death and rapid bodily decay. Despite severe physical deterioration, SCP-035 retains cognitive control over the host body.
    
    Conversations with SCP-035 have revealed its high intelligence and manipulative nature. It has demonstrated knowledge of various SCP objects and historical events. Psychological analysis indicates its ability to induce profound changes in the mental state of individuals, leading some to suicide and others to become obedient servants.
    
    SCP-035 has attempted multiple escapes, manipulating research staff to assist in its efforts. It possesses telepathic abilities, penetrating the subconscious of others to gather information. Recent developments include the secretion of human blood within its containment cell, along with disturbing patterns and diagrams on the walls. Personnel report hearing whispers and experiencing migraines in proximity to SCP-035.
    
    Efforts to contain SCP-035's escalating threats have included coating its containment cell with SCP-148 to mitigate negativity. However, this has led to increased psychological distress among personnel and heightened paranormal phenomena within the cell. Containment breaches are becoming more frequent, necessitating consideration of relocation to a new facility.</p>
