  <p>SCP-914, also known as "The Clockwork Machine," is a highly intricate device requiring specialized handling and rigorous oversight. Only personnel who have submitted a formal request and obtained approval from site command are permitted to operate SCP-914. The device is housed in research cell 109-B, where it is closely monitored by two guard personnel at all times. Researchers entering 109-B must be accompanied by at least one guard throughout the duration of testing. Prior to testing, a comprehensive list of experiments must be provided to the guard personnel on duty, and any deviation from the approved list will result in immediate termination of testing and disciplinary action at the discretion of site command.

    A critical warning prohibits the testing of biological matter with SCP-914, as outlined in document 109-B:117. Additionally, applying the "Rough" setting to explosive materials is strongly discouraged due to potential hazards.
    
    SCP-914's physical structure is characterized by its large clockwork design, encompassing a considerable area and comprising over eight million moving parts primarily made of tin, copper, wood, and cloth. The device features two booths labeled "Intake" and "Output," connected to the main body via copper tubes. A prominent knob on a copper panel allows for the selection of refinement settings, including Rough, Coarse, 1:1, Fine, and Very Fine. Adjacent to the knob is a winding key for the "mainspring," SCP-914's primary power source.
    
    When an object is placed in the Intake Booth and the knob is adjusted to a specific setting while winding the mainspring, SCP-914 initiates a refinement process. Remarkably, no energy loss occurs during this process, and the object remains in stasis until retrieved from the Output Booth. The mechanics behind SCP-914's refinement process remain a mystery, as no test object has ever been observed within the device during operation. Refinement typically takes between five and ten minutes, depending on the size of the object.
    
    A test log conducted by Dr. █████ reveals the diverse outcomes of various objects subjected to SCP-914's refinement process. From steel to wristwatches and even living organisms, SCP-914's capabilities yield a range of results, including disassembly, transformation, and, in some cases, anomalous alterations. The log highlights both the potential and unpredictability of SCP-914, underscoring the necessity for cautious experimentation and stringent containment measures.</p>
