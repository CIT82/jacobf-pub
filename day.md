# My Day
## *A not particularly interesting summary of my day so far*
### *By Jacob Falken*
1. Woke up and tried the new coffee I got
2. Realized I had no oil to cook with
3. Found out about a place giving free food
4. Got there 2 hours early because the posted schedule was bad and wrong
5. Got bored and tried to climb a tree (**unsuccessful**)
6. Finally got food

### **What I received**
- 2 sandwiches
- 6 salads
- Too many potatoes
- :egg:
- Other things that I can't remember
